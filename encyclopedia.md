Introduction

	Throughout history certain people have stood out as being just plain better than the rest of us. They seem to measure themselves on a different scale. If you invited them all to the greatest dinner party of all time, would they nod knowingly to each other in brotherhood, or leap into furious competition resulting in the deaths of thousands? Fortunately, we can only speculate as to what would happen if we assembled these men in one room, but we can at least assemble them in a book, this book, the Encyclopædia of Badasses. There are many dimensions to the badass. Some of our honorees lack in one or two of these dimensions, but rest assured that all of them are better than you.

Physical Courage:
imminent danger or death by choice

Eccentricity: Many books have been written about military heroes, and indeed there are plenty of military heroes in this book. However, while war is well-known as an opportunity for badass behavior, run-of-the-mill battlefield courage is not enough to qualify one as a badass. The fact is, people have been fighting and dying on battlefields for millions of years, and even the highest standards of bravery include so many warriors that after a while of reviewing their biographies they all start to look the same.
	
Wit: Many lucky idiots will be remembered for all eternity as badasses by the gullible. The true badass is in control at all times, and leaves very little to chance.

Good Intentions: In this book you will find many badasses who worked, and sometimes died, for causes which are now forgotten or condemned, and they may be considered badasses as long as they make up for it in wit and eccentricity.
